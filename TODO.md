## 🔄 Session Resilience & Host Disconnection

> **Principle:** A room is a durable object. A host is just a role.

### Room-Centric Architecture

- [x] **Persistent Room Model**
  - [x] Decouple room lifecycle from host connection
  - [x] Room survives host disconnects (status: `open | active | paused | closed`)
  - [x] Add `current_host_id` field (nullable) to sessions table
  - [x] Implement room TTL expiration (configurable, e.g., 24h inactive)
  - [x] Room only closes via explicit action or TTL expiration

- [x] **Media Sessions (Ephemeral)**
  - [x] Create `media_sessions` table (separate from rooms)
  - [x] Track media session properties: `id`, `room_id`, `mode`, `publisher_id`, `status`
  - [x] Media session states: `active | paused | ended`
  - [x] End/pause media session when host disconnects (room stays alive)
  - [x] Allow new media session to attach when host reconnects or transfers

### Host Disconnection Handling

- [x] **Immediate Behavior**
  - [x] Room remains open on host disconnect
  - [x] Viewers stay connected to UI, chat, presence, SFU (if applicable)
  - [x] Screen share pauses/freezes gracefully (last frame or placeholder)
  - [x] No automatic participant kick

- [x] **UX Messaging**
  - [x] "Host disconnected. Waiting for reconnection…" overlay
  - [x] Countdown timer or reconnection status indicator
  - [x] Clear visual state for "host offline"
  - [x] Only hard-kick when room is explicitly closed

### Reconnection Logic

- [x] **Grace Period**
  - [x] Implement host reconnection window (2-5 minutes configurable)
  - [x] Auto-reattach returning host (no participant disruption)
  - [x] Resume screen sharing on host reconnect
  - [x] ICE restart for P2P connections on reconnect

- [x] **Host Reassignment (if host doesn't return)**
  - [x] Option A: Admin/host can pre-designate backup host
  - [x] Option B: Auto-promote a controller to host role
  - [x] Option C: Viewer-only continuation (room stays alive, no screen share)
  - [x] New host can start fresh screen sharing session

### Presence & Heartbeats

- [x] **Client Heartbeats**
  - [x] Periodic heartbeat from all clients (every 30s)
  - [x] Soft-state presence (disconnection inferred, not immediate)
  - [x] Grace period before marking participant offline
  - [x] Avoid false "everyone dropped" on brief network blips

- [x] **Host Status Tracking**
  - [x] Track `host_last_seen_at` timestamp
  - [x] Distinguish between "host offline" vs "host left intentionally"
  - [x] Broadcast host status changes to all participants

### SFU vs P2P Behavior

- [x] **P2P Mode**
  - [x] Media streams drop on host disconnect
  - [x] Room stays alive for chat/presence
  - [x] Reconnect requires SDP renegotiation
  - [x] Participants not kicked

- [ ] **SFU Mode (Better UX)**
  - [ ] SFU keeps viewer connections alive
  - [ ] Viewers see last frame or placeholder
  - [ ] New publisher can attach seamlessly
  - [ ] No participant connection disruption
